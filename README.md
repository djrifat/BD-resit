# BD-resit
Benchmarking Keras and Pytorch by training two CNN to classify Covid-19 on X-ray scans of lungs. Data is scraped from Kaggle and Github.

# Data usage
Please use the 'data' folder for the Keras CNN and the 'dataset' folder for the Pytorch CNN. Both folders contain the same images. Pytorch expects a sub-directory with a 'train' and 'validation' folder, whereas Keras does not require this.
